      <p>Lilly enters the castle through golden gates and is greeted by a fairy princess. Lilly tells her, "Hi, my name is Lilly. What's your name?"

The princess tells her, "My name is Dewdrop."

"You look tired Lilly," she says. "My golden eagle Highflyer will take you home."

So Lilly climbs up on the eagle. The eagle takes off from the castle and flies over the great forest to take her home.</p>
